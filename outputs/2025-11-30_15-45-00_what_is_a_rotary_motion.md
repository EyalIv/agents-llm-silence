## 🧘 The Masters Speak

### Monk Dōgen asks:
> When the potter's wheel turns, is the turning a thing apart from the wheel, or does the wheel itself *become* the turning in that precise, unceasing moment?

### Ludwig Wittgenstein asks:
> Under what specific conditions do we *say* 'rotary motion' rather than simply 'it's turning' or 'it's spinning'?

*In silence, understanding deepens.*
