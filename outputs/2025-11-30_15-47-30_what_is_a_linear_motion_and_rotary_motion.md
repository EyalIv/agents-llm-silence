## 🧘 The Masters Speak

### Monk Dōgen asks:
> When your body steps 'straight' upon the earth, does not the earth itself turn beneath your foot? And when your hand spins, what straight mark does it leave in this very moment?

### Ludwig Wittgenstein asks:
> What are the *circumstances* under which you would apply the label "linear motion" to a movement, as distinct from "rotary motion", and what *purpose* does this distinction serve in the particular language-game you are playing?
