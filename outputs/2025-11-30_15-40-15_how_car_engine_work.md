## 🧘 The Masters Speak

### Monk Dōgen asks:
> When the metal heats and the oil flows, and the very air burns within its chambers, where does the engine's hum meet the silence of your own passing?

### Ludwig Wittgenstein asks:
> When we say 'this is *how* a car engine works,' what sort of *explanation* are we offering, and to what end? Are we describing pistons, thermodynamic cycles, or the proper way to repair a fault? What *game* are we playing with this 'how'?

*In silence, understanding deepens.*
